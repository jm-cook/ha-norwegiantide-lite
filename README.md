This is a Home Assistant custom integration for Norwegian Tide which is interfacing an open API by the [Norwegian Mapping Authority (Kartverket)](https://kartverket.no/en/), more precisely [sehavniva.no](http://www.sehavniva.no/) which provides information about water levels and tidal predicitions and forecasts. **All data is Â©Kartverket**.

Unfortunately the service only provides data for geographical positions in Norway - this is a limitation in the API and not in this integration.


## Installation
There are different methods of installing the custom component. HACS is by far the simplest way for unexperienced users and is recomended.

### HACS installation
The installation is currently not included in HACS as a default repo, but can be installed through HACS *by adding this repo as a custom repository*.

1. Make sure you have [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) installed in your Home Assistant environment.
2. Go to **HACS**, select **Integrations**.
3. Click on the three dots in the upper right corner and select **Custom repositories**
4. Copy/paste the **URL for this repo** `https://github.com/tmjo/ha-norwegiantide` into the URL-field, select **Integration as category** and then click **Add**.
5. You should now find the **Norwegian Tide** integration by searching for it in HACS, proceed to install it.
